### Slicing arrays
Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.

We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].

We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].

If we don't pass start its considered 0

If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension

If we don't pass step its considered 1


### string natural sort
```python
# Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4836710/is-there-a-built-in-function-for-string-natural-sort/4836734#4836734
import re

def natural_sort(l): 
    convert = lambda text: int(text) if text.isdigit() else text.lower() 
    alphanum_key = lambda key: [ convert(c) for c in re.split('([0-9]+)', key) ] 
    return sorted(l, key = alphanum_key)

```
